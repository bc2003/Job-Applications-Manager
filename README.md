# Job Application Manager
Bryan Chang

## Introduction

For the CPSC 210 project, I will be creating a 
job application manager which can keep track of all
your job applications. This application allows you to input 
information about a job/internship of interest. The actual management aspect 
is that users can update their job application status 
to prospective (simply interested in applying) or applied. 
The user can also update the final status which states whether they have 
accepted a job offer, turned down a job offer, 
or got rejected. I will also let the user manually 
remove a job from the manager if they wish to do so.

This target group for this project is mainly anybody 
actively searching for internships or full-time positions, 
especially students. The reason behind this project
is that in my current pursuit of finding internships,
I am managing all the jobs I have in mind on Microsoft
Excel. While this works, it would be nicer to have
some application which will manage all my job applications
more efficiently.
